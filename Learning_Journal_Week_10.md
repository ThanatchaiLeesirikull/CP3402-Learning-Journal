## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I focused on preparing for my upcoming presentation. The preparation involved setting up my laptop and ensuring that all the equipment I intend to use for the presentation functions properly. I watched relevant tutorials and consulted various resources to refine my approach, including practicing the flow and delivery of the presentation.

## Estimated Hours

I spent four hours to complete this practicals. The follow action that I have done are individual presentation rehearsal, group presentation rehearsal, and setting up my laptop.

## Content Insights

From this rehearsal process, I learned that it is important to engage in early and repetitive practice. Once an incomplete version has been created, even if the presentation is not completely done, one can identify areas for improvement as well as any gaps in the work. Rehearsing multiple times means that my content improves and I become more comfortable with speaking.
