## Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I explored Sass to enhance my website development skills. Sass, a CSS preprocessor, provides powerful features such as variables, nested rules, and mixins. I learned how to use Sass to streamline the styling process, with real-time compilation to CSS files through extensions like Live Sass Compiler.

## Estimated Hours

I spent around four hours learning Sass, which included setting up the necessary extensions, experimenting with Sass syntax, and observing the real-time changes in CSS files.
