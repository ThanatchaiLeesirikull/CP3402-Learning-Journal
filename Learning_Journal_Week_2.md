## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I have set up joomla software, then get into the software right away. At the beginning of using joomla, I learn the software functionality while building the website at the same time. I found that joomla can do many things although it hard to use. Joomla has a complexity of usage as the function itself it hardly to be found. It requires time and effort for the user to get familiar with the template of the sofware, navigating back and forth to find what they want.
